## Instructions for running the software

* Install all the libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the folder `graph-algorithms`. 

## Running the GUI
* `cd graph-algorithms` and then run `python3 MainApplication.py`
* A `GUI` would open up in the screen
* Click on `File` and choose `New Graph`.

### Features of the GUI

* On `double left-click` a `Node` object is added in the graphical scene.
* On `left-click`, the `Node` is selected.
* `right-click` on the selected `Node` removes it.
* Press and hold the mouse from the source node to add edge
* Same goes for the `Edge` object.
* On selecting the `Edge/Node`, it becomes highlighted.
* The screen readjusts to keep the Graph centered.

### Saving and Loading a Graph

* To save the current graph, click `Save Graph`, make sure to save the file with a `.graph` extension.
* To load previous graph, click on `Load Graph`.
