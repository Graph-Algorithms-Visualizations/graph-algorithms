## Instructions for running the software

* Install all the libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the folder `graph-algorithms`. 

## Running the GUI
* `cd graph-algorithms` and then run `python3 MainApplication.py`
* A `GUI` would open up in the screen
* Click on `File` and choose `New Graph`.

### Features of the GUI

* On `double left-click` a `Node` object is added in the graphical scene.
